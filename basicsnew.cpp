// we are going to build the program and then run the program
// we tell our computer what to do
// running is different from building it 

// main() is important the execution starts from the main function
// any thing after the curly braces will be running 

// cout  means console out to print in the console endl is the end of the line

// program was the bunch of instructions for computer to execute something

// more complex instructionf and the more complex is the program

// variable is the container that stre the value and main taint it

// variable major use will comes with the usability and 
// value resuability
